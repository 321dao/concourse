# Contributing to Concourse

(TODO)

Hi there. We're shuffling everything around and the dust hasn't quite settled
yet. Expect useful content here within a few days. Sorry!

tl;dr: you need Go 1.11, development is a bit more natural on Linux (because
Concourse uses containers), and there are utility scripts under `dev/` for
running a local Concourse.
